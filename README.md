The code performs three main tasks: Time Series Analysis, Regression Analysis, and Sales Data Analysis.

1. Time Series Analysis:

It defines functions to generate seasonal and demand data.
It generates sample time series data using these functions.
It builds a Bayesian linear model using PyMC to model the trend in the time series data.
2. Regression Analysis:

It generates synthetic regression data using make_regression.
It builds a Bayesian linear regression model using PyMC to estimate the relationship between the predictor and target variables.
3. Sales Data Analysis:

It loads a sales dataset from a CSV file.
It builds a Bayesian model using PyMC to analyze the sales data, potentially focusing on understanding the distribution of sales.
